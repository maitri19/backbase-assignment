## Assumption ##

- I have not validated movie title against movie database for rating API. Assuming that rating api will be called from application frontend under a page/screen for movie details. So frontend application can validate movie title. 
- Given list of movies are only for oscar nominee movies. Non-oscar nominated movies can also be rated.
- Box office value must always be available.
